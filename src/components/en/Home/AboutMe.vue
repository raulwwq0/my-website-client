      <p>
        My name is Raúl and I'm from Málaga. I have been coding since I was 15,
        when my ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) teacher
        discovered me Python, a programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the beginning of my travel in self-taught learning, and also
        with the help from some courses where I learned new programming
        languages and technologies, allowing me to develop a huge ability to
        solve problems and becoming myself in a person who you can put your
        trust in. In addition, I love working in a team, where I will always try
        to do my best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, my main goal is web development, without forgetting about mobile 
        and videogames development.
